In this, you will find Freighter seeds that I or others have discovered (please feel free to submit your own), which look good with my mod: hF's Freighter Retexture (0.81).
Most are Metallic and are thus capable of being Golden Freighters. I just found my first Golden-capable Resurgent Class Freighter yesterday and she's a beaut... 

Below you will find seeds as well as their sources. I will also provide a short guide meant to get you started with swapping seeds.

Note that Home Seeds aren't important anymore. You can keep it the same. However for those who are new to seed swapping, I will provide a home seed,
one which can be used with any model seed below: 0x50003668D82

Basic How To:

You will need either NMS Save Editor (by goatfungus) or NomNom Save Editor (by zencq). I personally use NMS Save Editor, but NomNom will work just fine for this as well.

After you've downloaded and installed your Save Editor, you'll open it up, select your appropriate NMS save, go to the "Freighter" section, and replace the "Model Seed"
with the one you've selected from above (or elsewhere for that matter). Again, you don't need to replace the "Home Seed" as it's practically obsolete nowadays, but if you must, use the one up above. 
Be sure to save your changes before exiting. If ever a seed is invalid, NMS Save Editor will prevent you from saving those changes. I do not know if NomNom does this, but it's a good feature to have
-- as the last thing you want to do is to brick your save over a freighter seed!
